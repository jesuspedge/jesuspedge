# 👋🏽 Hello there, Roger here!

I'm a Mobile Developer at Filup RH who's passionate about continuous learning and personal projects. I'm always eager to collaborate with fellow developers and constantly work on improving my development skills, with a particular love for exploring new things in mobile development.
When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing guitar as a hobby and spending time with my four playful cats who keep things interesting at home!
